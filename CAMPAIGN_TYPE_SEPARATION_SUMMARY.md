# Campaign Type Separation Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Objective Completed**
Updated the Campaign Performance New section to separate mixed campaigns into distinct campaign cards - one for social and one for email, with type-specific metrics and displays.

## ✅ **Implementation Details**

### **🔄 Campaign Processing Logic**
**Files Updated**:
- `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/brand-performance/campaign-performance-new/page.tsx`
- `app/api/brand-campaigns/route.ts`

**New Logic**:
- **Mixed campaigns** are automatically split into two separate cards
- **Social campaigns** show social-specific metrics (reach, engagement, platforms)
- **Email campaigns** show email-specific metrics (emails sent, opens, clicks)

### **📊 Campaign Card Changes**

#### **Before (Mixed Campaign)**
```typescript
{
  campaign_id: '1',
  campaign_name: 'Spring Collection Preview',
  campaign_type: 'mixed', // Single mixed card
  total_reach: 285000,
  total_engagement: 24500,
  total_emails_sent: 1500
}
```

#### **After (Separated Cards)**
```typescript
// Social Campaign Card
{
  campaign_id: '1-social',
  campaign_name: 'Spring Collection Preview (Social)',
  campaign_type: 'social',
  total_reach: 199500, // 70% of original
  total_engagement: 17150, // 70% of original
  total_emails_sent: 0 // No emails for social
}

// Email Campaign Card
{
  campaign_id: '1-email', 
  campaign_name: 'Spring Collection Preview (Email)',
  campaign_type: 'email',
  total_reach: 85500, // 30% of original
  total_engagement: 7350, // 30% of original
  total_emails_sent: 1500 // Keep original email count
}
```

## 📱 **UI Changes**

### **🎨 Campaign Card Display**

#### **Social Campaign Cards**
- **Badge**: "social" type indicator
- **Metrics Displayed**:
  - **Social Reach**: Total social media reach
  - **Social Engagement**: Social media interactions
  - **Platforms**: "4 platforms" (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn)
  - **Retailers**: Number of participating retailers
- **Key Metric**: "Engagement Rate" (higher rate for social)

#### **📧 Email Campaign Cards**
- **Badge**: "email" type indicator  
- **Metrics Displayed**:
  - **Emails Sent**: Total emails delivered
  - **Email Opens**: Calculated as 25% of emails sent
  - **Email Clicks**: Calculated as 3% of emails sent
  - **Retailers**: Number of participating retailers
- **Key Metric**: "Click Rate" (email-specific terminology)

### **📊 Metric Calculations**

#### **Social Campaign Metrics**
- **Reach**: 70% of original mixed campaign reach
- **Engagement**: 70% of original mixed campaign engagement
- **Engagement Rate**: 1.2x multiplier (social typically higher)
- **Platforms**: Fixed at "4 platforms"

#### **📧 Email Campaign Metrics**
- **Reach**: 30% of original mixed campaign reach
- **Engagement**: 30% of original mixed campaign engagement
- **Click Rate**: 0.8x multiplier (email typically lower)
- **Email Opens**: 25% of emails sent (industry average)
- **Email Clicks**: 3% of emails sent (industry average)

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Campaign Processing Function**
```typescript
const getMockCampaigns = (): Campaign[] => {
  const baseCampaigns = getBaseCampaigns()
  const processedCampaigns: Campaign[] = []

  baseCampaigns.forEach(campaign => {
    if (campaign.campaign_type === 'mixed') {
      // Split into social and email campaigns
      const socialCampaign = { /* social-specific data */ }
      const emailCampaign = { /* email-specific data */ }
      processedCampaigns.push(socialCampaign, emailCampaign)
    } else {
      // Keep single-type campaigns as they are
      processedCampaigns.push(campaign)
    }
  })

  return processedCampaigns
}
```

### **Type Interface Update**
```typescript
interface Campaign {
  campaign_id: string
  campaign_name: string
  campaign_status: 'active' | 'paused' | 'completed' | 'draft'
  campaign_type: 'email' | 'social' // Removed 'mixed' option
  // ... other properties
}
```

### **Conditional Metrics Rendering**
```typescript
{campaign.campaign_type === 'social' && (
  // Show social-specific metrics
)}

{campaign.campaign_type === 'email' && (
  // Show email-specific metrics
)}
```

## 🎯 **Campaign Examples**

### **Example 1: Spring Collection Preview**
**Original**: 1 mixed campaign card
**Result**: 2 separate cards
- **Social Card**: "Spring Collection Preview (Social)" - shows social metrics
- **Email Card**: "Spring Collection Preview (Email)" - shows email metrics

### **Example 2: Winter Wonderland Exclusive** 
**Original**: 1 mixed campaign card
**Result**: 2 separate cards
- **Social Card**: Higher engagement rate, platform count
- **Email Card**: Email opens/clicks, lower engagement rate

### **Example 3: Holiday Luxury Campaign**
**Original**: 1 email campaign card
**Result**: 1 email card (unchanged - already single type)

## 🔍 **Visual Indicators**

### **Campaign Type Badges**
- **Social**: Blue "social" badge
- **Email**: Green "email" badge
- **No more "mixed"**: All campaigns now show single type

### **Icon Usage**
- **Social Campaigns**: Eye (reach), MousePointer (engagement), Users (platforms)
- **Email Campaigns**: Mail (emails sent), Eye (opens), MousePointer (clicks)

### **Metric Labels**
