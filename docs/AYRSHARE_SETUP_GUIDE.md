# Ayrshare API Setup Guide

## üîë Getting Your Ayrshare API Key

To complete the social media analytics integration, you'll need to obtain an Ayrshare API key and configure it in your environment.

### Step 1: Sign Up for Ayrshare

1. Visit [Ayrshare.com](https://www.ayrshare.com)
2. Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one
3. Choose a plan that includes API access (usually Business or Enterprise plans)

### Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. Log into your Ayrshare dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **API Keys**
3. Generate a new API key or copy your existing one
4. Make note of your API key (it will look something like: `ayr_abc123def456...`)

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file with your actual Ayrshare API key:

```bash
# Replace 'your_ayrshare_api_key_here' with your actual API key
AYRSHARE_API_KEY=ayr_your_actual_api_key_here
AYRSHARE_BASE_URL=https://app.ayrshare.com/api
```

### Step 4: Connect Social Media Accounts

In your Ayrshare dashboard:

1. **Connect Platforms**: Link your LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and Google Business Profile accounts
2. **Set Up Profiles**: Configure profile keys for each connected account
3. **Test Connection**: Verify that all accounts are properly connected

### Step 5: Configure Profile Keys

Each connected social media account will have a unique profile key in Ayrshare. You'll need to map these to your retailers in the CrownSync database.

Example profile keys:
- LinkedIn: `linkedin_profile_123`
- Instagram: `instagram_profile_456` 
- Facebook: `facebook_profile_789`
- Google Business: `google_business_profile_012`

### Step 6: Test the Integration

Once configured, you can test the integration:

```bash
# Run the Supabase connection test
node scripts/test-supabase-connection.js

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to /dashboard/brand-performance/social-analytics
```
