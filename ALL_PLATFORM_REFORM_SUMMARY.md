### 3. **Interactive Trends Visualization**
- Real-time trend charts with 30-day historical data
- Switchable metrics: Total Reach, Average Engagement Rate, Total Link Clicks, New Followers
- 7-day moving averages for smoother trend analysis
- Platform-specific color coding for easy identification

### 4. **Ayrshare API Compatibility**
