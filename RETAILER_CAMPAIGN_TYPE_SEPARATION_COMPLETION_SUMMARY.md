  const socialCampaign = { ...campaign, campaign_type: 'social', platform_performance: {...} }
  const emailCampaign = { ...campaign, campaign_type: 'email', email_metrics: {...} }
}
```

### **Frontend Type-Specific Rendering**
```typescript
// Social campaigns show platform tabs and analytics
{campaign.campaign_type === 'social' && (
  <Tabs value={selectedPlatform} onValueChange={setSelectedPlatform}>
    // Platform-specific analytics and charts
  </Tabs>
)}

// Email campaigns show email-specific metrics
{campaign.campaign_type === 'email' && campaign.email_metrics && (
  <div className="space-y-6">
    // Email performance overview, engagement metrics, rates
  </div>
)}
```
