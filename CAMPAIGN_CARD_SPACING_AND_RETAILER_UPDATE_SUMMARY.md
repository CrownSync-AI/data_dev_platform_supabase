# Campaign Card Spacing and Retailer View Update Summary

## 🎯 **Issues Addressed**

### **1. Reduced Spacing Above Bottom Metrics**
- **Issue**: Too much space (pt-4 + pt-3) above the bottom performance grading section
- **Solution**: Reduced spacing from `pt-4` and `pt-3` to `pt-2` and `pt-2`
- **Result**: More compact layout with better visual balance

### **2. Increased Campaign Image Space**
- **Issue**: Campaign images were only 192px (h-48) tall, limiting visual impact
- **Solution**: Increased image height from `h-48` to `h-56` (224px)
- **Result**: 32px more space for campaign images, better visual prominence

### **3. Updated Retailer Campaign View**
- **Issue**: Retailer view was not updated with the same improvements as brand view
- **Solution**: Applied all the same refinements to retailer campaign cards
- **Result**: Consistent experience across both brand and retailer views

## 🔧 **Technical Changes Made**

### **Brand Campaign View (`CampaignCardView.tsx`)**
```tsx
// Before: h-48 (192px)
<div className="relative h-48 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-t-lg">

// After: h-56 (224px) - 32px more space
<div className="relative h-56 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-t-lg">

// Before: pt-4 + pt-3 = 28px spacing
<div className="mt-auto pt-4">
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between pt-3 border-t">

// After: pt-2 + pt-2 = 8px spacing
<div className="mt-auto pt-2">
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between pt-2 border-t">
```

### **Retailer Campaign View (`RetailerCampaignView.tsx`)**
Applied all the same improvements:

1. **Card Layout**: Added `flex flex-col h-full` for consistent height
2. **Title Space**: Added reserved 56px height container for titles
3. **Image Size**: Increased from `h-48` to `h-56`
4. **Content Layout**: Added `flex flex-col h-full` and `flex-grow` to content
5. **Bottom Alignment**: Used `mt-auto pt-2` for bottom section alignment
6. **Reduced Spacing**: Changed from `pt-3` to `pt-2` for bottom metrics

### **API Updates**
**Both Brand and Retailer APIs**: Removed redundant suffixes
```typescript
// Before
campaign_name: `${campaign.campaign_name} (Social)`
campaign_name: `${campaign.campaign_name} (Email)`

// After
campaign_name: campaign.campaign_name // Clean titles without suffixes
```

## 🎨 **Visual Improvements**

### **Image Space Increase**
- **Before**: 192px height for campaign images
- **After**: 224px height for campaign images
- **Benefit**: 17% more visual space for campaign imagery

### **Spacing Optimization**
- **Before**: 28px total spacing above bottom metrics (pt-4 + pt-3)
- **After**: 8px total spacing above bottom metrics (pt-2 + pt-2)
- **Benefit**: 71% reduction in excessive spacing, more compact layout

### **Layout Consistency**
