# Mixed Type Removal and Date Fix Summary

## 🎯 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Eliminated "Mixed" Campaign Type**
- **Problem**: Campaigns still had "mixed" type which doesn't exist anymore
- **Solution**: Changed all "mixed" campaigns to "social" type
- **Result**: Clean campaign types (only "social" and "email")

### **2. Confirmed Recent Campaign Dates**
- **Problem**: User reported dates weren't updated
- **Verification**: Dates ARE actually updated to December 2024 - January 2025
- **Result**: All campaigns now show current/recent dates

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **API Updates (`app/api/brand-campaigns/route.ts`)**
```typescript
// Before: Mixed types
campaign_type: 'mixed'

// After: Social types only
campaign_type: 'social'
```

**Campaigns Fixed:**
- ✅ Spring Collection Preview: `mixed` → `social`
- ✅ Winter Wonderland Exclusive: `mixed` → `social`

**Logic Simplified:**
- ✅ Removed complex mixed-type processing logic
- ✅ Simplified to direct campaign usage: `let filteredCampaigns = baseCampaigns`

### **Component Updates (`CampaignCardView.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Fixed all mixed types in mock data
campaign_type: 'mixed' → campaign_type: 'social'
```

**Mock Campaigns Fixed:**
- ✅ Spring Collection Preview: `mixed` → `social`
- ✅ Winter Wonderland Exclusive: `mixed` → `social`  
- ✅ Modern Minimalist Series: `mixed` → `social`
